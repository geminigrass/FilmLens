# Assumptions:
One big issue in real word situation is that movies can have the same name. To handle this, we simply use RottenTomato's own search and return the first hit. The reson why we do this is that Manor Theater doesn't provide the release year of any on-showing movie, they identify movies by poster instead, which makes it impossible for our programe to identify movies according to names.
