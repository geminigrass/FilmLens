Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough.

They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite...

It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ...

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough.

They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite...

It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ...

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough.

They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite...

It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ...

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough.

They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite...

It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ...

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough.

They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite...

It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ...

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough.

They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite...

It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ...

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough.

They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite...

It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ...

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough.

They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite...

It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ...

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough.

They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite...

It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ...

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough.

They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite...

It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ...

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough.

They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

[Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite...

It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition.

It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"

Hammer is not so lucky.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci seems content to focus on the conventional, the artist's self-doubt and obsession, without addressing what Giacometti saw in Lord or what he was searching for. Why is this portrait, which sold for more than $20-million, artistically significant?</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci transforms an artist's world into a flurry of process... In the movies that Tucci has managed to get made as a writer-director, each finds process central... It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ...

It's a sweet signature, as transfixing as the features of his fellow actors.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> At it's core, Final Portrait is a movie that offers insight into the artistic process and the friendships that go with it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a film, it's well-made and the performances are fine, but it feels slight and thin and inconsequential - quite the opposite of the work Alberto Giacometti left behind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci impresses in depicting Giacometti's creative process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Geoffrey Rush gives a methodical performance that captures the intricacies of a complex tortured artist, and to the film's benefit, he swears, smokes, and paints through nearly every scene</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait isn't much of a biography, a character study, a joke, or an examination of the mind of an artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's drama Final Portrait does the impossible: It finds a use for Armie Hammer's simultaneous beauty as a man and blandness as a performer.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is barely 90 minutes long, which is about right, and several of those minutes are wordless - patient and observant of the artist's surroundings, inquisitive regarding what Giacometti is trying to will into being.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait does an excellent job of capturing the anxiety, the malaise, and distraction that comes from wanting to create something.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This movie is a meticulous dossier of the artistic process by one man who created it and another man who lived through it. Not your usual bill of fare at the movies, but well worth the patience to make it pay off.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" is basically just an anecdote about a painting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A patient, un-presuming 90 minutes that never undertakes being more than the sum of its parts - more baguette than glossy, sugar-crowned croquembouche.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's screenplay lacks depth yet captures some intimate surface details about his subject, while Rush's performance brings sympathy to a mercurial figure who's otherwise off-putting.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> James may be Giacometti's final portrait, but I sincerely hope this won't be Tucci's.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's inexplicably grayish palette doesn't do the artist or the artwork any favors, and the action, which mostly takes place in Giacometti's plaster sculpture-strewn studio, is stagey. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Insightful story about art has language, sexual situations. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I cannot recommend ""Final Portrait"" enough. It is a small but significant masterpiece in the over-populated landscape of giant, noisy productions.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush's performance calls to mind his Oscar-winning turn in ""Shine"" (1996) where he played a crazed pianist. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> An involving examination of the creative process itself, of how difficult it can be to move forward with artistic enterprises no matter how gifted you are or how much regard the world holds you in.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's no plot, really, but the actors are superb, the cinematographer also made The King's Speech, and this flick is the next best thing to running off to Paris to lead the bohemian genius life yourself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""Final Portrait"" (adapted from Lord's 1965 book, ""A Giacometti Portrait"") is pretty thin on drama.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's look at the legendary artist Alberto Giacometti (a live-wire Geoffrey Rush) is a mesmerizing meditation on the mystery of genius and anything but paint by numbers. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Alberto Giacometti paints a portrait of his friend James Lord in this sterile exercise that fails to gain dramatic traction from the artist's quest for perfection.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci settles in behind the camera with what I imagine to be a tiny smile, savoring the step-by-step process of creation from both his characters and his actors. They're fun to watch.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film captures the outside appearances of an artist at work and then suggests, humbly, that the work inside, the trick of genius, might be so subtle that even the artist can't detect it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A solid look at the cultural dissonance between two artists of distinct temperaments.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delicate minuet. And Tucci, who gets fine performances from Rush and Hammer, manages to pull it off. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A very interesting and suggestive film. [Full Review in Spanish] </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A bleakly funny, genteelly twisted gloss on the clichés of temperamental creative genius, via the relationship between an artist and his subject, one that questions the sometimes high personal price of great art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is not an innovative proposal, but not too trite... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This modest, extremely charming labor of love from writer/director Stanley Tucci is not intended for anyone who can't wait for the next Transformers. But if you're interested in Paris, art, the 1960s or any combination, it may be right up your alley.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's fifth movie is like an engagingly acted episode stretched into a feature. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> A low-key drama of consistently high quality... </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci presents an engaging overview of the artist, undoubtedly one that will inspire viewers to continue their own exploration of a fascinating character.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Avoids the usual biopic pitfalls, yet succumbs to the half-baked slightness that can plague talky, miniaturist chamber pieces. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Giacometti's endless delaying tactics and his prosaic nature means Final Portrait weirdly feels both once over lightly and somewhat slow all at once.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Everything about the film's tone is pitch perfect, from its monochromatic palette, touched up with dabs of colour, to its lilting score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci knows just how to direct his Oscar-winning lead in Final Portrait - containing that theatrical flourish within a relatively economical storyline. It makes for a film in which watching paint dry is oddly fascinating.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci's achievement is to have worked so successfully with one great artist, Rush, in the creative portrayal of another great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... Final Portrait is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of what it means to be a great artist and what it means to create art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Final Portrait is filled with acute vigor, seamlessly-interwoven humor, impeccable historical accuracy, and superb acting that combine for another Tucci gem.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's faint drama percolates pleasingly during the face-offs between artist and sitter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a very enjoyable drama, by turns hilarious and touching, and Rush gives a rich portrait of a dedicated craftsman who truly suffered for his art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like most modern biopics, it focuses on a short period in his life rather than the whole span but it gives a good sense of the man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> In Stanley Tucci's spare, sly film, Geoffrey Rush blends cantankerous charisma and seething self-doubt as the Italian-Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti, with Armie Hammer as the suave American writer whom he asks to sit for him in his chaotic studio.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The seemingly infinite, repetitive nature of their interactions become surreal, hilarious and exasperating, though [Stanley] Tucci imbues them with a genuine affection for the artistic process.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush has never been better. It's a small film built around a very big performance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's the stuff of a terrific chamber piece here, but it's drastically unbalanced by Geoffrey Rush's showy whimsicality as the mercurial maestro.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Far from a complete painting, this is a sketch, an outline, done in casual, quick strokes and left both intriguingly and frustratingly rough ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Beautiful production values not withstanding, what should make for a fascinating biopic is rendered dull by a conventionally plotted father-son storyline ...</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Niche but nice.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a delightful, nimble miniature, as thought-provoking in the long term as it is wryly entertaining in the moment.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait, his first film in 10 years, is in a class of its own.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Rush and Hammer are as good as the material allows, occasionally better.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stellar performance from Geoffrey Rush centres this diverting glimpse into the chaotic life of a great artist.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti was famed for his spindly sculptures; Tucci's film feels similarly stretched.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Just because you signal to an audience that you're purposefully making them watch paint dry does not make the experience of it any less tedious.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""...a subtle and low-key affair about the great Swiss-Italian artist Alberto Giacometti.""</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The worst trait a movie can present is lack of ambition. [Full review in Portuguese.]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Tucci captures his subject from a range of interesting angles without ever resorting to po-faced portraiture himself.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A shaggy-dog story about the frustrations of genius.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of those films that will not be released on the billboard of its country, because its potential audience is non-existent. It's designed for some cable channel like HBO, because it's basically like a prestigious telefilm. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> As a bit of art-house escapism, that it is a trip well worth taking.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.</div>]"
