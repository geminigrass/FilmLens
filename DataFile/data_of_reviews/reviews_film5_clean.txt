this

emotionally
if

still
with

the

youre
probably
with

possibly
for

it
lingers
its
a

the
compression
its
narrative
while
its
impact
leaves
you
dazed
you
cant
quite
believe
what
youve
seen
happened
based
on
the
novella
jonathan

the
film
the
casual
sadistic
violence
a
tarantino
film
but
none
the

the
excellent

that
you
never

director

evokes
a

the
film
is
a
bad
trip
so
trippy
you
could
start
to
enjoy
its
fortissimo
miserabilism
an
intense
brutal
thriller
this
is
our
millenniums
taxi

ramsay
is
now
for
one
our
exciting
filmmakers
if
she
could
not
leave
it
so
next
time
thats
fine
with
us
you
dont
watch
a
ramsay
film

youre
consumed
it
you
were
never

here
is
the
greatest
testament
to
that
lynne
ramsay
returns
with
a
scuzzy
strippedback
thriller
focused
on
the
rather
the
mission
plays
out
as
you
expect
with
ramsay
maintaining
an
unsettling
staccato
that
keeps
the
action
the
viewer
on
edge
arguably
the
finest
films
the
decade
with
careerbest
work
from

masterful

ramsay
if
the

its

a

external

its

the
internal
work
her
leading

presents
as
just
your
run
the
mill
revenge
thriller
but
as
a
character
study
a
killer
it
is
anything
but
run
of
the
mill
this
is
a
stunning
gutpunch
of
a

it
thumps
