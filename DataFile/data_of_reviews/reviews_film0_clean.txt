a
comprehensive

to
those
who
say

from
the
most

circumstance
in
a
weak
for

comedy
the
death

can
easily
stake
a
claim
the

funniest

just
because
the

not
iannuccis
funniest
most

does

its

letdown
a

that
finds

in

watch
feel

the
tone
up

oddly
serious
the

the
final
product
is
somehow
more

less

than
iannuccis

silliest
work
actual
quantities
of
laughter
are
diluted
by
the
difficult

the

the

whirring

occupy
you
anyway
the

is

painfully
close

once

the

despite
capturing
the
laughable
sycophancy
of
the

the

isnt

the

is
savagely

the

freezes

you

this
horrible
can
ever
be

funny

punchy
raucous
savagely

it

a

mile
though
the
death
of
stalin
is
an
entertaining
often
funny
film
the
tone
of
which
will
be
familiar
if
not
wholly
so
to
fans
of
iannuccis
excellent
previous
work
this
is
not
iannuccis
work
iannucci
a
bad
day
is
better
than
most
on
a
good
day
there
are
brilliant
moments
you
just
cant
argue
simon
russell

in
anything

its
not
nearly
hours
wasted
witty
scarily
pertinent
to
almost
any
organisation
the
death
of
stalin
is
so
brilliant
its
a
privilege
to
watch
it
darker
more
violent
than
iannuccis
previous
work
this
is
a
brilliantly
acted
very
funny
black
comedy
underscored
a
jolt
of
genuine
horror
depending
on
your
point
of
view
the
death
of
stalin
is
either
a
sly
wintry
satire
on
armando
iannuccis
usual
theme
of
squawking
political
idiocy
an
insidious
attempt
to
destabilise
the
russian
establishment
relentless
daggerblows
iannuccis
version
of
events
may
be
well
researched
but
it
still
gives
us
a
very
british
very
witty
but
facetious
version
of
a
dark
story
which
might
have
been
better
told
by
an
insider

armando
iannuccis
passable
screwball
comedy
which
might
aspire
to
satire
but
actually
isnt
so
an
audacious
comedy
of
horrors
the
film
the
feel
of
a
bad
dream
you
find
yourself
not
wanting
to
wake
up
from
a
riotous
farce
of
doublespeak
plotting
laced
moments
of
bitumenblack
horror
make
sure
you
pay
your
respects
to
the
funniest
film
of
2017
as
monty
python
meets
tvs
the
thick
of
it
in
this
outrageous
and
brilliant
historical
satirical
farce
taken
strictly
as
a
workout
in
elastic
ensemble
performance
and
rapidfire
verbal
pugilism
the
death
of
stalin
is
consistently
entertaining
but
enjoying
iannuccis
film
means
depoliticizing
the
source
material
mixes
hard
shocks
and
big
laughs
to
often
dazzling
effect
a
film
as
riotously
funny
as
it
is
alarmingly
pertinent
this
is
classic
comedy
gold
in
many
reminiscent
of
the
monty
python
show
sketches
skewering
politicians
but
with
a
slightly
more
serious
spin
armando
iannucci
pulls
off
a
balancing
act
thats
more
remarkable
the
more
you
think
about
it
this
is
a
movie
thats
both
mercilessly
grim
and
uproariously
funny
the
death
of
stalin
is
full
of
pithy
oneliners
and
cringeinducing
power
struggles
laced
with
black
humor
surreal
intriguing
and
strangely
affecting
the
death
of
stalin
is
simultaneously
familiar
and
totally
to
anything
armando
iannucci
done
armando
iannucci
never
in
a
film
that
looks
this
ravishing
which
serves
as
an
juxtaposition
with
all
the
topshelf
cruelty
on
display
heaps
of
praise
will
be
deservedly
lumped
onto
the
core
cast
but
some
of
the
movies
sharpest
moments
from
the
supporting
cast
the
death
of
stalin
is
a
scathingly
funny
satire
about
powermad
nerds
and
bumbling
bureaucrats
that
could
only
come
from
armando
iannucci
this
may
be
iannuccis
weakestwritten
film
but
its
by
far
his
bestdirected
one
