his

is

ensuring
the
wordplay
of

title
cant

ring

tribute

studio

original
inventive
oddly
topical
this
is
a
tasty
treat
for

aficionados

fans
alike
a
winningly
affectionate
delightfully
detailed
dystopian
fable
isle
of
dogss
invocations
of
corruption
militarism
leave
a
sour
taste
in
the
mouth
of
anyone
unable
to
abandon
the
thought
of
the
world
outside
of
the
films
perimeters
in
place
of
a
satisfying
whole
it
is
still
entirely
pleasurable
to
once
again
get
lost
in
andersons
signature
wash
of
exquisite
detail
isle
of
dogs
is
basically
a
fizzy
ornately
mounted
assembly
of
quirks
and
barks
the
sheer
artistry
displayed
is
so
expertly
accomplished
and
so
clearly
fueled
love
that
you
cant
help
grin
a
certain
cuteness
preciousness
is
what
has
made
andersons
films
the
object
of
scorn
for
some
curmudgeonly
critics
nevertheless
the
fantasy
realm
of
a
talking
dog
universe
prevents
trademark
whimsy
from
congealing
sentimentality
this
gorgeous
and
rambunctious
stop
motion
adventure
wes
anderson
at
his
most
imaginative
and
looselimbed
isle
of
dogs
emerges
as
a
profoundly
andersonian
tribute
to
his
love
of
japanese
cinema
particularly
to
hayao
miyazaki
the
film
is
packed
with
laughoutloud
moments
full
of
deadpan
observations

a
quintessential
anderson
touch

and
exciting
sequences
isle
of
dogs
may
be
ruff
the
edges
but
its
an
exquisitely
rendered
animation
overloaded
with
visual
gags
and
dry
humour
while
andersons
many
fans
doubtless
enjoy
unpicking
the
films
visual
delights
the
rest
of
us
may
find
isle
of
dogs
delivering
a
lot
of
bark
but
not
bite
this
is
some
measure
andersons
weirdest
concoction
ever
in
all
sorts
of
good
and
it
probably
counts
as
his
most
daring
too
andersons
trademark
tongueincheek
humour
and
deadpan
quips
are
there
to
ease
the
way
which
seem
more
fluidly
delivered
puppets
than
in
andersons
liveaction
fare
dont
the
fluffy
fool
you
wes
andersons
animation
delivers
talking
dogs
and
snickerinducing
scenarios
but
its
also
bleak
and
frequently
unsettling
a
dazzling
family
movie
with
the
darkest
of
hearts
ultimately

the
most
striking
thing
about
andersons
fastidiousness
is
that
its
all
in
done
in
the
service
of
chaos
anderson
is
clearly
a
dog
lover
and
his
film
is
bound
to
appeal
to
anyone
shares
his
passion
all
in
all
the
film
is
quite
a
treat
unable
to
find
the
magic
line
between
beauty
and
temperament
or
irony
and
earnestness
the
scale
tips
from
humanityand
dogmanityand
ends
up
lacking
the
wes
anderson
heart
that
were
likewise
puzzled
by
and
endlessly
yearning
for
with
the
help
of
an
incredible
of
talented
artists
and
performers
its
a
movie
that
plays
on
the
best
of
the
writerdirectors
sensibilities
while
accessing
entirely
brand
new
areas
of
it
