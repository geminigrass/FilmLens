not

this
is
someone

of

you

pace
watching
donald

helen

so
smitten
in

with

is
just

it
occurred
to
me
early
the

adapted

paolo
virzis
film
based
on
a
novel
michael
zadoorian
holds
surprises
leaving
us
with
enjoyable
set
pieces
in
a
disappointing
movie
the
sentiment
is
admirable
the
execution
decidedly
is
not
it
is
too
bad
this
touching
story
is
couched
in
a
mediocre
road
trip
its
a
sweet
premise

that
isnt
fleshed
in
the
leaden
screenplay
which
leans
heavily
on
the
most
obvious
americana
trappings
to
gin
a
lighter
of
senility
the
leisure
seeker
is
a
pleasant
distraction
though
the
endgame
is
depressing
theres
beauty

virzi
is
too
humane
to
make
a
movie
beautiful
moments
a
scattered
eight
10
minutes
of
splendor
just
isnt
worth
an
almost
twohour
investment
of
time
the
performers
are
always
lively
engaging
sometimes
moving
worth
contemplation
the
script
flags
when
a
film
doesnt
to
deal
with
a
tough
subject
honestly
it
does
so
with
dishonesty
instead
the
leisure
seeker
is
one
of
the
most
dishonest
pictures
of
its
type
made
are
occasional
flashes
of
sweetness
charm
the
dont
add
to
substantial
do
not
be
fooled
this
stellar
twosome
helen
mirren
and
donald
sutherland
the
leisure
seeker
is
as
bad
as
they
alas
the
leisure
seeker
is
neither
funny
nor
poignant
and
without
those
two
attributes
the
finale
has
emotional
depth
no
matter
how
likable
sutherland
and
mirren
are
theyre
stuck
in
little
more
than
an
upbeat
wishfulfillment
fantasy
gentle
bittersweet
journey

notable
its
fine
performances
if
only
the
film
had
something
to
say
americaor
memory
about
families
somewhat
generic
mostly
agreeable
played
donald
sutherland
and
helen
mirren
two
dodge
much
of
the
icky
adorableness
movies
as
this
usually
heap
on
old
people
thats
not
to
say
the
characters
are
all
that
noteworthy
just
very
well
acted
