But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.

Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]</div>]"

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike.

You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> What a film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers). </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> ... a raw thriller... [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]</div>, <div class=""the_review""> One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix.

Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A journey to the deepest levels of the dark side, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is an art-house crime thriller that succeeds on every technical and creative level.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> [We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent. </div>, <div class=""the_review""> Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> Here, for once, style delivers substance.</div>, <div class=""the_review""> But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here.
