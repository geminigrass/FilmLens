the

its

this
is
a
brilliantly

funny
black
comedy
underscored
a

genuine

depending
on
your

the
death
stalin
is
either
a
sly
wintry
satire
on

an

us
a

version
a
dark

which
might
have
been
better
told
by
an

armando
iannuccis
passable
screwball
comedy
which
might
aspire
to
satire
but
actually
isnt
so
an
audacious
comedy
of
horrors
the
the
feel
of
a
bad
dream
you
find
not
wanting
to
wake
up
from
a
riotous
farce
of

you

monty

taken
strictly
a

the

is

but
enjoying

means
depoliticizing
the
source
material
mixes
hard
shocks
big
laughs
to
often
dazzling
effect
a
riotously
funny
it
is
alarmingly
pertinent
this
is
classic
comedy
gold
in
many
ways
reminiscent
of
the
monty
python
sketches
skewering
politicians
but
a
slightly
more
serious
spin
armando
iannucci
pulls
a
balancing
act
thats
more
remarkable
the
more
you
think
about
it
this
is
a
thats
both
mercilessly
grim
uproariously
funny
the
death
of
stalin
is
full
of
pithy
oneliners
cringeinducing
power
struggles
laced
black
humor
surreal
intriguing
strangely
affecting
the
death
of
stalin
is
simultaneously
familiar
totally
to
anything
armando
iannucci
done
armando
iannucci
has
never
turned
in
a
that
this
ravishing
which
serves
an
interesting
juxtaposition
all
the
topshelf
cruelty
on
display
heaps
of
praise
will
be
deservedly
lumped
the
core
cast
members
but
some
of
the
movies
sharpest
moments
from
the
supporting
cast
the
death
of
stalin
is
a
scathingly
funny
satire
about
powermad
nerds
bumbling
bureaucrats
that
could
only
from
armando
iannucci
this
may
be
iannuccis
weakestwritten
but
its
by
far
his
bestdirected
one
those
whove
enjoyed
armando
iannuccis
day
career
the
driving
force
the
thick
of
it
veep
the
death
of
stalin
reassuringly
offers
more
of
the
same
as
perfectly
conducted
as
the
orchestra
performances
that
open
close
the
the
death
of
stalin
zips
merrily
as
alliances
formed
plots
are
hatched
lives
are
destroyed
the
death
of
stalin
is
iannuccis
most
complex
almost
nihilistic
rendering
of
what
politics
is
a
team
of
bumbling
weakminded
who
lack
any
real
conviction
other
than
a
desire
for
power
position
iannucci
masterfully
blends
dark
humour
about
an
authoritarian
regime
farcical
comedy
performed
with
perfect
timing
its
application
of
iannuccis
signature
barbed
comic
voice
to
such
grim
history
executions
are
a
constant
source
of
gallows
humor
packs
its
own
punch
a
delicious
black
comedy

it
will
more
than
satisfy
iannuccis
fans
at
arthouses
heres
hoping
we
dont
have
to
wait
eight
years
to
the
directors
the
death
of
stalin
marks
the
first
instance
in
which
iannucci
has
applied
his
style
to
reallife
figures
and
its
as
though
he
has
crafted
a
historical
foundation
for
the
rest
of
his
work
master
satirist
armando
iannuccis
is
ostensibly
a
comedy
but
the
laughs
dont
come
easy
and
the
jokes
are
often
laced
with
malice
and
paranoia
there
is
one
thing
that
power
cant
stand
and
that
is
to
be
mocked
the
social
importance
of
this
topical
romp
not
be
underestimated
an
occasionally
funny
often
straightfaced
about
a
cruel
leaders
cronies
and
how
selfinterest
doesnt
stall
for
death
a
raunchy
hilarious
history
lesson
although
the
laughs
dont
come
as
frequently
as
in
the
loop
veep
the
death
of
stalin
is
still
consistently
funny
and
delightfully
meanspirited
iannuccis
brand
of
political
satire
is
applied
to
one
of
the
darkest
chapters
in
modern
history
with
sensational
results
n
our
age
of
real
life
selfmocking
opinionated
hogwash
the
surrealistsatirist
iannucci
has
with
the
death
of
stalin
once
again
nailed
it
armando
iannucci
always
a
sharp
observer
of
the
complex
motivations
that
fuel
political
behavior
doesnt
miss
a
beat
as
lurid
as
dark
comedies
the
death
of
stalin
is
one
of
the
years
most
outrageously
fun
and
provocative
films
the
death
of
stalin
is
superbly
cast
and
acted
with
icy
and
ruthless
force
by
an
alist
