infinity

is

folks
this
is
the
marvel

been
building
for
a
decade
its
astonishing
a
culmination
without
being
a
finale
avengers
infinity
war
is
an
impressive
achievement
blockbuster
moviemaking
but
theres
denying
that
expectationwise
the
mcu
is
starting
to
look
a
bit
like
a
victim
its
own
success
this
completely
utterly
belongs
to
josh
brolins
warmongering
villain
thanos
marvel
has
set
an
amazing
stage
for
avengers
infinity
war
my
only
real
question
walking
into
the
was
how
they
possibly
bring
all
this
a
that
works
as
an
actual
youll
be
shocked
how
well
they
pull
it
all
the
past
decades
marvel
movies
have
been
heading
this
showdown
turns
the
payoff
was
worth
the
wait
its
too
much
too
many
characters
too
much
action
too
much
everything
its
a
superhero
surplus
too
many
heroes
not
screen
its
infinity
overload
if
only
the
better
modulated
perhaps
longer
more
elegantly
shaped

well
its
hard
to
say
whats
wrong
sitting
through
its
2
hours
30
minutes
is
like
gorging
tapas
you
wind
both
overstuffed
unsatisfied
avengers
infinity
war
delivers
an
exciting
culmination
the
mcu
though
its
overstuffed
suffers
from
certain
typical
marvel
problems
the
most
ambitious
most
audacious
most
mindblowing
superhero
ever
produced
this
is
why
the
superhero
genre
exists
this
is
a
knockout
scifi
that
travels
the
universe
back
not
only
does
it
capture
the
vastness
that
but
its
also
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
colorful
marvel
has
released
to
date
a
cinematic
world
stuffed
with
bigbudget
movies
infinity
war
is
a
genuine
blockbuster
a
wildly
ambitious
incredibly
successful
exercise
longform
cinematic
storytelling
part
what
makes
infinity
war
thrilling
is
the
way
it
weaves
its
various
narrative
strands
into
a
seamless
wholeor
at
least
as
close
to
seamless
as
one
reasonably
hope
after
10
years
lean
threadbare
lilliputian
tales
marvel
studios
has
thank
heavens
finally
decided
to
go
big
the
russo
brothers
have
clearly
never
learned
the
concept
that
less
is
more
theyve
used
the
premise
an
avengers
reunion
to
put
on
a
fireworks
explosion
action
laughs
those
roguish
guardians
that
wont
quit
even
by
marvels
own
standards
serviceable
mediocrity
infinity
war
fails
infinity
war
is
big
blustery
brave
taking
viewers
to
places
that
they
may
not
be
used
to
going
thanos
as
an
villain
is
menacing
powerful
with
a
purpose
he
believes
his
mission
is
the
right
mission
no
matter
how
heinous
it
may
be
this
is
definitely
a
fun
but
it
doesnt
for
a

overlong
overcrowded

but
it
gives
everyone
a
go
on
the

to
dramatic
if

infinity

is
a
wildly
ambitious
entertaining
ride
which
good
old

team
work
just
about
carries
the
day
here
the
specialness
comes
from
the
pleasure
seeing
all

full

in

the
cliffhanger
climax
of
infinity
war
left
the
audience
at
my
screening
in
a
state
that
can
only
describe
with
the
most
tired
of
critical
clichés
they
were
stunned
not
even
the
threat
of
universal
annihilation
it
seems
will
keep
this
assembly
line
from
chugging
ahead
with
its
signature
polished
mechanized
efficiency
theres
no
pacing
in
avengers
infinity
war
its
all
sensation
no
pulse
everything
is
big
all
of
the
time
even
as
the
forces
audiences
to
submit
to
so
many
cataclysmic
events
the
directors
manage
to
direct
the
cascading
mayhem
to
a
unique
kind
of
cliffhanger
the
one
overriding
joy
that
continually
propels
infinity
war
to
better
things
stems
from
watching
the
come
alive
as
so
many
disparate
elements
react
to
one
another

lies

flavors
in
its
10year
legacy
from
heist
films
and
political
thrillers
to
space
operas
and
fantasy
epics
now
it
boasts
a
fullfledged
shakespearean
tragedy
what
saves
infinity
war
from
being
just
another
bloated
supergroup
tour

and
what
will
end
being
the
thing
that
blows
fans
minds
to
dust

is
the
films
final
stretch
the
noisy
bloated
spectacles
of
combat
were
surely
the
most
expensive
parts
of
the
but
the
money
seems
less
like
an
imaginative
tool
than
a
substitute
for
genuine
imagination
the
action
is
great
and
there
is
much
good
humor
but
this
is
clearly
the
appetizer
for
next
years
big
finish
its
a
unique
exceptional
achievement
that
somehow
leaves
you
both
fully
satisfied
and
desperate
for

this

may
be
on
its
last
legs
but
as
tablesetting
for
an
even

threat
infinity
war
daringly
leaves
more
questions
in
the
air
the
way
this
world
ends
looks
to
be
not
with
a
bang
but
a
whimper
its
just
a
supremely
watchable
utterly
confident
in
its
selfcreated
malleable
mythology
and
confident
also
in
the
note
of
apocalyptic
darkness
know
its
silly
and
yet
cant
looking
forward
to
the
next
supersized
episode
of
mayhem
what
infinity
war
accomplishes
with
surprising
ease
is
complete
immersion
in
this
elaborate
world
reflecting
how
deft
marvel
has
been
in
assembling
it
avengers
infinity
war
cares
a
bit
too
much
about
being
part

and
holding

development
for

but
mcu
fans
should
their
10year
buildup
expectations
met

not
exceeded
but
met
for
the
first
time
in
a
while
i
cant

to
see
what
happens
next
it
pays
off
the
emotional
