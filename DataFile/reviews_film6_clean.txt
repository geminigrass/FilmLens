tully
is
its
when
its
simply
moving
intuitively
one
negotiated
respite
to
the
theron
holds
the
her
hands
gives
it
to
like
a
gift
one
accept
joy
it
works
well
it
is
to
a
screenplay
largely
drops
codys
signature
sarcasm

so
often
to
mask
painful
underlying
secrets

a
voice
is
more
raw
direct
tully
encapsulates
the
psychological
process
maturity
pithy
humor
vertiginous
insight
it
is
brutally
hilariously
honest
motherhood

will
it
an

jason
reitman

diablo
cody
approach
the
material
with
the
freshness
filmmakers
learning
things
themselves
figuring
how
to
reconcile
grownup
with
they

a
major
about
motherhood
in
which
codys
signature

handles

with
sensitivity
an
unflinching

humorous
desperately
moving

cracks

theron
is
astonishingly
good
giving
a
subtle

performance
full
of
deadpan
comedy
emotional
truth
sharply
observed

tenderly
realised
tully
brings
back
the
reitman
we
knew
loved
represents
codys
finest
work
juno
reminds
why
theron
deserved
2004
oscar
in
marlo
diablo
cody
created
her
most
complicated
character
to
date
that
her
writing
displayed
similar
richness
empathy
in
painting
the
films
supporting
characters
its
real
raw
bruising
bleak
and
honest
to
fault
all
this
makes
it
entirely
wonderful
as
its
an
unapologetic
unwavering
unvarnished
at
motherhood
tully
is
a
remarkable
for
its
admirable
effort
at
portraying
a
stripped
down
raw
version
of
the
mother
fulfillment
genre
